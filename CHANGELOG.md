**Migration Guide (0.3.8 ‚Üí 0.4.0)**

If you were using the VS Code extension:

1. **Uninstall the VS Code extension** (if previously installed)
2. **Install the CLI globally**: `npm install -g package-checker-cli`
3. **Use new command syntax**: `checker help "your question"`
4. **Enjoy enhanced AI capabilities** with natural language processing

The CLI tool provides all previous functionality plus powerful AI assistance that can understand and solve problems described in natural language.
